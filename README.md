- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rihards, I am telecommunications engineer with a Masters degree in Telecommunications, and I am currently studying PhD in telecommunications
- However, Iâ€™m interested in software development, because it always has attracted my attention. I have been working as a researcher writing scientific. 
  publications (I have 9 of them), and working at international scientific projects, but I feel that I am not getting everything I want from the current job.
- Iâ€™m currently learning/refreshing everything I learnt during Accenture bootcamp (bootcamp was several years ago) and during studies in University on JavaScript, 
  React, HTML, CSS, PHP, node.js. During studies in university I have also learnt fundamentals in C, C++, Python, Java. 
- I would like to aquire experience by working on React projects, so I can develope my skills and in future by adding backend skills
  to become full-stack sotfware engineer. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project including web development, so feel free to contact me.
