- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rihards, I am a telecommunications engineer with a Master's degree in Telecommunications, and I am currently studying Ph.D. in telecommunications
- However, I'm interested in software development because it always has attracted my attention. I have been working as a researcher and lecturer, writing
  scientific publications (I have 9 of them), and working on international scientific projects, but I feel that I am not getting everything I want from the 
  current job.
- I'm currently learning/refreshing everything I learned during Accenture Bootcamp (Bootcamp was several years ago) and during studies at University on   
  JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, PHP, node.js. During my studies in university, I have also learned fundamentals in C, C++, Python, Java. 
- I would like to acquire experience by working on React projects, so I can develop my skills and in the future by adding backend skills
  to become a full-stack software engineer. 
- I'm looking to collaborate on any project, including web development, so feel free to contact me.
